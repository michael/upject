                Over more than a decade, Upject has built the <b>Saleshub Application</b> in close cooperation with Canon. Saleshub's core system features a <b>Configure/Price/Quote</b> solution tailored specifically to Canon's requirements, and over the years it has gained more and more features and modules, making it a powerful toolkit for both, direct and indirect sales. It has since been in use
                in <b>a number of NSOs</b> including Austria, Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland, and can look back on more than <b>10 years of battle proven operation</b>. This document outlines the key features within the context of indirect sales functionality.

            <p>
                By setting up configuration rules and product dependencies, you can define which products have to go with each other, which products can't be combined, and much more. This avoids configuration mistakes and resulting additional deliveries, and helps your sales team save time and money.

            <p>
                The Saleshub application continuously updates all relevant figures and calculates the project profitability with each change in the configuration. Partners, sales staff and management always have the numbers at hand which they need to make an informed decision.

            <h1>Project Requests</h1>
            <p>
                Partners can enter project requests, requesting target prices for specific projects. Based on a fully adjustable workflow definition, these project requests enter an approval process involving all relevant roles. After a successful approval of the request, partners can order the goods with the approved target price directly in the application.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Depending on project volume, product types, delivery and payment conditions, service contract, etc. the approval process can go through various steps, and might involve sales managers, service departement, finance departement, up to the management board, just to make an example. The approval process is fully customizable and adjustable to your business processes
                and compliancy rules.

            <h1>Different Views for different Roles</h1>
            <p>
                Saleshub can store various types of prices. Each role is assigned to a specific pricing scheme, this allows you to set salesman cost prices for your sales team, while avoiding to reveal your landed cost prices. 
            </p>
